### How It Works
1. **User Input:** Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board.
2. **Game Board:** The board is a 3x3 grid where players place their marks.
3. **Win/Tie Detection:** The game checks for a win (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) or a tie (no more empty spaces and no winner).
4. **Output Result:** The game announces the result (win/tie) and play for another round.

### Game Logic
- **Board Representation:** The board is represented as a 2D array or list.
- **Player Turns:** Players alternate turns to place their marks.
- **Win Conditions:** Check all rows, columns, and diagonals for three identical marks.
- **Tie Condition:** Check if all spaces are filled without a winner.
